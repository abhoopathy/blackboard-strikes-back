## Course Communication

Two mechanisms to reach the TAs and instructors exist:
1. A discussion board in the blackboard environment <http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard/>
2. A private listserv <hcii-methods-2012@lists.andrew.cmu.edu>

Blackboard is a the university-supported system for course delivery. .
To get started, go to <http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard/> and follow the
instructions about logging in and accessing class information.

The blackboard’s discussion board feature is comprised of a series of
forums; each forum corresponds to each course topic. If you have a
question about a course topic and/or assignment, please scan the
appropriate forum first to make sure the question was not previously
answered. If you have personal questions that you need to discuss with
your TA or course instructor, email the listserv and make sure you
explicitly state who the email is addressed to.

In addition, the course staff will sometimes post important
announcements on Blackboard. By default, the Blackboard tool uses your
Andrew email account to disseminate messages and announcements. Please
confirm that you have set this up correctly. You are responsible for
monitoring Blackboard and/or your email daily to keep track of
announcements.

## Course Overview

Human computer interaction (HCI) is an interdisciplinary field drawing
on psychology and the social sciences, computer science, engineering,
and design. Professionals in the field use diverse methods and tools to
understand, improve, and create technology that harmonizes with and
improves human capabilities, goals, and social environments. This course
is an introduction to user3centered practice in HCI. 

Understanding the design space. The first half of the course takes you
into the worlds of “users” and the technologies they use. The purpose of
this half of the course is to learn key methods for understanding people
and identifying opportunities for design. You will learn how to
understand users’ work in context, in order to tease out underlying
practices, motivations, and goals. To do this, you will learn a method
called “contextual design” for becoming immersed in users’ experience to
develop options to designing for users’ goals and contexts. You also
will learn how to conduct a competitive analysis of existing products
and services as well as learn how to cull the existing literature to
understand the domain of interest, the state of the art in technology,
and relevant behavioral theories. At the end of this half of the course
you will have completed the first half of contextual design (through
visioning); the second half of contextual design will be taught in a
different course. 

Evaluating products and services. The second part of the course gives
you the tools for evaluating potential designs, whether these are
scenarios you’ve sketched on paper or prototypes you’ve built. You will
learn to draw on user data and the existing environment to sketch out a
potential design that will speak to user and client needs. You will
learn how to walk through a prototype, product, or service, and apply an
expert review. You will learn how to perform web analytics to understand
how people are using the web. You will learn a technique called think
aloud to evaluate how people are using a prototype, product, or service.
And finally, you will learn how to write reports on your findings that
speak to clients’ needs.
